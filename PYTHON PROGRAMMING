Welcome to this lecture on decision making in Python!
Decision making is a crucial part of any program as it allows the program to make choices based on certain conditions.
In Python, we have several ways to implement decision making, and in this lecture, we will learn about some of the most commonly used ones. 
If Statement The most basic form of decision making in Python is the  if statement. 
It allows the program to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. Here's the syntax for an if statement: 
if  condition: # code to  be executed if  condition   is   True  Here's an example of an if statement in action:   x =  10 if  x > 5 : 
print ( "x is greater than 5" )  In this example, the condition is x > 5, 
which is True, so the code block print("x is greater than 5") is executed. 
If…else Statement Sometimes, we want to execute a different block of code if the condition is not met. In such cases, 
we can use the if…else statement. Here's the syntax for an if…else statement:   if  condition: 
# code to  be executed if  condition is  True  else: # code to  be executed if  condition  is   
False  Here's an example of an if…else statement in action:
